# Open Hospital - Developer Portal 

The Open Hospital - Developer Portal allows the developers and the maintainers of Open Hospital Software to browser through the documentations in all-in-one place. 

## Why? 

Documenting code is one of the most important and time-heavy processes when developing Open-Source software. Usually, the developers might want to browse different documentation pages without leaving the same place or open different browserâ€™s tabs. 

This portal allows the user to easy browse the documentations without jumping from a repo to another one finding the right doc. 

## How it works? 

This Website is built over [Docz][docz] and [Gatsby][gatsby] and the data is taken from markdown files (such as README.mdx) from the different Open Hospital repos. 

## What is Open Hospital? 

[Open Hospital][openhospital] (OH) is an electronic health record (EHR) application. 
Open Hospital is currently provided as a desktop application written in Java and it's designed to work without an internet connection.  

Which repositories can I browse through? 
The Open Hospital - Developer Portal is composed by the following pages:  

- [OH][home], which contains all the packages and repos of Open Hospital 
- [OH Core][core], a library that contains the business logic and the data abstraction layer  
- [OH GUI][gui], which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) made with Java Swing  
- [OH Doc][doc], which contains the user and admin documentation in Asciidoc format  
- [OH UI][ui], a web user interface that consists of a React SPA (single page application) [*WIP*]  
- [OH API][api], a web server that exposes REST APIs over the Core component, and it's used by the UI component [*WIP*].
