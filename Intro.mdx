# Open Hospital - Developer Portal

The Open Hospital - Developer Portal allows developers and maintainers of Open Hospital Software to browser the documentations in all-in-one place.

## Why?

Documenting code is one of the most important and time-heavy processewhen developing Open-Source software. Usually, the developers might want to browse different documentation pages without leaving the same place or open different browserâ€™s tabs.
This portal allows the user to easily browse the documentation without jumping among the software repositories in search of the right documentation page.

## How it works?

This website is built by using [Docz][docz] and [Gatsby][gatsby]. The data is taken from markdown files (such as README.mdx) from the different Open Hospital repositories.

## What is Open Hospital?

[Open Hospital][openhospital] (OH) is an electronic health record (EHR) application. It is currently provided as a desktop application written in Java and designed to work without an internet connection.

Which repositories can I browse through? The Open Hospital - Developer Portal is composed of the following pages:

- [OH][home], which contains all the packages and repos of Open Hospital
- [OH Core][core], a library that contains the business logic and the data abstraction layer
- [OH GUI][gui], which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) made with Java Swing
- [OH Doc][doc], which contains the user and admin documentation in Asciidoc format
- [OH UI][ui], a web user interface that consists of a React SPA (single page application) [*WIP*]
- [OH API][api], a web server that exposes REST APIs over the Core component, and it's used by the UI component [*WIP*].
- [OH Portable][portable], download the "single station" bundle in order to test it.
